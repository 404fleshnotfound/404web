        <p>a shithead coder, tattooer, artist. junky for brutalist design, futurism, and love. </p>
        <p>the flesh protocol and encrypted sigilism in gen. was birthed with the idea that sometimes less is more. </p>
        <p>but also more is more. </p>

        <p> here's the lore. </p>
        <p>born and raised in nyc. i grew up listening to punk, started coding at 11, was making art way before then and get my heartbroken at 14. </p>
        <p> was an activist for, still am, just more of an internet robinhood now - i guess. was a corpo for a while, quit. play shows to fucking no one. adore every minute of it. </p>
        <p> get popular on the internet for a while. it fucking sucked, it was fun, it fucked me up. </p>
        <p> realize that within society right now, true artistry is impossible. so i drop off the face of the fucking planet. </p>
        <p> im bouncing around the country for a little while. reading, writing, writing songs, ruminating. </p>
        <p> i knew i didn't want to run the rat race, i didn't want to chase temporary.  i fucking hate "content" and AI and all the fucking bs </p>
        <p> so i slow way down, go back to my roots. move back home, making punk music in my childhood room. </p>
        <p> i start tattooing, start coding again, never stopped making art. </p>
        <p> i start to realize that the internet is a tool, and i'd like to use it to spread a better ideology not built around doom. </p>
        <p> now i'm here. </p>
        <p> tattooing is real different, it's raw, it's intimate. it's heavy. </p>
        <p> but there's a lot of love, a lot of trust, a lot of feeling and that's why i make art. </p>
        <p> bc if ur not feeling, wtf are u doing? </p>
